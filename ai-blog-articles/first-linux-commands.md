# First Linux Commands

f you're new to Linux, there are a few basic commands that you should learn in order to get started. These commands will allow you to navigate the file system, manage files and directories, and perform other common tasks on a Linux system. Here are some of the first commands you should learn on Linux:

* `pwd`: This command stands for "print working directory," and it shows you the path of the current directory you are in. This is useful for keeping track of where you are in the file system and making sure you are in the correct directory when you run other commands.
* `ls`: This command lists the files and directories in the current directory. It's a useful way to see what's in a directory and navigate the file system.
* `cd`: This command stands for "change directory," and it allows you to move to a different directory in the file system. For example, you can use `cd /home/user/documents` to move to the "documents" directory inside your home directory.
* `mkdir`: This command stands for "make directory," and it allows you to create a new directory in the file system. For example, you could use `mkdir my_new_directory` to create a new directory called "my\_new\_directory" in the current directory.
* `touch`: This command allows you to create a new file in the current directory. For example, you could use `touch my_new_file.txt` to create a new text file called "my\_new\_file.txt" in the current directory.

These are just a few examples of basic Linux commands that you can use to get started with the operating system. There are many other commands available, and as you learn more about Linux you'll discover even more useful tools and features.
